About
Taking notes as the prof writes all over the blackboard is a tedious rite of passage in college. Despite the ubiquity of smartphones however, taking photos of the blackboard is not a practical alternative due to awkward angles, poor focusing & just being plain cumbersome. Our app allows students to snap photos of the blackboard even from the most awkward angle in room & use image processing to make the resulting photo appear as if it's taken directly in front of the blackboard. By using open source computer vision algorithms we can easily automatically detect blackboard borders, post process and have the algorithm stitch together a nice PDF for you automatically in the end.
